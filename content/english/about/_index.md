intro: |
  Domain Methods was founded on a simple belief: data work should favor practical elegance and deliver measurable outcomes.

  We specialize in marketing data, revenue analytics, and analytics engineering for SaaS and ecommerce companies. Our clients are typically mid-size companies (100-1000 employees) who know they need better data but are not sure who to trust or what to do next.

  bio: |
    I started Domain Methods because I kept seeing the same problem: smart teams with messy data making decisions on gut feel instead of evidence. After years leading analytics and data engineering for SaaS and ecommerce companies, I got tired of watching organizations drown in dashboards nobody trusts.

    My approach is simple — I solve the hard problems (architecture, strategy, proof-of-concept), then hand off to your team or our trusted network of specialists for execution and long-term support. You get senior-level thinking on day one, without paying for a full team when you don't need one.

    Domain Methods isn't a traditional agency. We're a small, flat team of experienced practitioners backed by a trusted network of specialists we've worked with across multiple engagements. When a project needs specific expertise — whether that's Databricks migration, advanced dbt modeling, or activation engineering — we bring in people we've already vetted and collaborated with. No junior staff learning on your dime. No layers of account management. Just direct access to people who know the stack and understand your business.

    I regularly share practical insights on marketing data, attribution, and analytics engineering — [follow me on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jasonbhart/) to stay in the loop.

## Our Approach

We are obsessed with truth and UX. That means we build analytics that are not just accurate, but actually get used. We follow the 80/20 rule — focusing on the 20% of work that delivers 80% of the value.

## How We Work

We start with understanding your specific challenges, not selling a pre-packaged solution. If we are not the right fit, we will tell you.

For the right projects, we bring deep expertise in:

- **Marketing analytics and attribution** — Understand which campaigns and channels drive results
- **Revenue operations and metrics** — Build dashboards and reports your team can trust
- **Modern data stack** — dbt, cloud warehouses, and best-in-class tooling
- **Data activation and reverse ETL** — Put your warehouse data to work
