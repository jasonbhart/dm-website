intro: |
  Domain Methods was founded on a simple belief: data work should favor practical elegance and deliver measurable outcomes.

  We specialize in marketing data, revenue analytics, and analytics engineering for SaaS and ecommerce companies. Our clients are typically mid-size companies (100-1000 employees) who know they need better data but are not sure who to trust or what to do next.

  bio: |
    I started Domain Methods because I kept seeing the same problem: smart teams with messy data making decisions on gut feel instead of evidence. After years leading analytics and data engineering for SaaS companies, I got tired of watching organizations drown in dashboards nobody trusts.

    My approach is simple — I solve the hard problems (architecture, strategy, proof-of-concept), then build systems that your team can actually own and run. I'm not here to create dependency. I'm here to create clarity.

## Our Approach

We are obsessed with truth and UX. That means we build analytics that are not just accurate, but actually get used. We follow the 80/20 rule — focusing on the 20% of work that delivers 80% of the value.

## How We Work

We start with understanding your specific challenges, not selling a pre-packaged solution. If we are not the right fit, we will tell you.

For the right projects, we bring deep expertise in:

- **Marketing analytics and attribution** — Understand which campaigns and channels drive results
- **Revenue operations and metrics** — Build dashboards and reports your team can trust
- **Modern data stack** — dbt, cloud warehouses, and best-in-class tooling
- **Data activation and reverse ETL** — Put your warehouse data to work
