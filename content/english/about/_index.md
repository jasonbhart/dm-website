## Translating messy data into decisive action

Domain Methods was founded on a simple belief: data work should favor practical elegance and deliver measurable outcomes.

We specialize in marketing data, revenue analytics, and analytics engineering for SaaS and ecommerce companies. Our clients are typically mid-size companies (100-1000 employees) who know they need better data but are not sure who to trust or what to do next.

### Our approach

We are obsessed with truth and UX. That means we build analytics that are not just accurate, but actually get used. We follow the 80/20 rule — focusing on the 20% of work that delivers 80% of the value.

**What we believe:**

- Data should drive decisions, not just fill dashboards
- Practical elegance beats theoretical perfection
- Trust is earned through clarity and results
- The best analytics are the ones people actually use

### How we work

We start with understanding your specific challenges, not selling a pre-packaged solution. Discovery calls are about clarity, not pitches. If we are not the right fit, we will tell you.

For the right projects, we bring deep expertise in:
- Marketing analytics and attribution
- Revenue operations and metrics
- Modern data stack (dbt, cloud warehouses)
- Data activation and reverse ETL
