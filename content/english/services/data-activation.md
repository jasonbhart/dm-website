# Client Outcomes
clients:
  case_studies:
    - client: "PLG SaaS Product Team"
      outcome: "First reverse ETL workflow shipped in 3 weeks, reduced churn by 18%"
      summary: "A PLG SaaS company had rich behavioral data sitting in their warehouse but no way to act on it. We built an MVP activation workflow that synced churn-risk scores to their CRM and triggered automated outreach. The first use case proved value so quickly that the team expanded to three more activation workflows within the quarter."
    - client: "Mid-Market Ecommerce SaaS"
      outcome: "Warehouse-as-CDP replaced a $120K/year vendor tool"
