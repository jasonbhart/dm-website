  title: "Build a Trusted Data Foundation"
  content: "For data leaders who need more than technical capacity — you need a partner who understands your business context. We build trusted data foundations using dbt, open-source tools, and modern cloud warehouses like BigQuery, Snowflake, and Databricks on GCP and AWS. Fast to start, built to govern, and designed so your team owns it from day one."

# Client Outcomes
clients:
  case_studies:
    - client: "Beacon Analytics"
      outcome: "Pipeline reliability from constant firefighting to 99%+ uptime"
      summary: "A 200-person SaaS company's data team was spending half their time fixing broken pipelines instead of delivering insights. We implemented a dbt-based transformation layer with automated testing, documentation, and clear governance processes. Their data team shifted from reactive maintenance to proactive analysis within six weeks."
    - client: "NovaTech Solutions"
      outcome: "Migrated from legacy ETL to modern cloud warehouse in 8 weeks"
      summary: "A venture-funded B2B platform was outgrowing their legacy data infrastructure. We designed and implemented a migration to BigQuery with dbt, preserving business logic while adding data quality tests and documentation. Their team now manages the entire stack independently."
