Most SaaS companies don't have an attribution problem. They have a **trust** problem.

Marketing says one thing, finance says another, and the CEO doesn't believe either number. Sound familiar?

The issue isn't which attribution model you pick. It's that your data pipeline, your tracking, and your reporting were never designed to answer the question you're actually asking: **"Is our marketing spend generating revenue?"**

## Stop Obsessing Over Models

First-touch, last-touch, multi-touch, data-driven — the model matters far less than whether your underlying data is clean, consistent, and connected to actual revenue.

I've watched teams spend six months debating attribution models while their UTM parameters were inconsistent, their CRM data was garbage, and nobody could agree on what counted as an "opportunity." That's not an attribution strategy. That's a trust deficit.

## The Three Things That Actually Matter

Before you pick a model, nail these:

### 1. Track the Full Journey

From anonymous website visit to closed-won deal, in one place. Not "marketing has their data" and "sales has their data" and "finance has different data." One journey. One source.

This means connecting your web analytics, your marketing automation, your CRM, and your billing system. It's not glamorous work, but it's the foundation everything else sits on.

### 2. Connect Marketing Data to Revenue Data

Not leads. Not MQLs. Not "influenced pipeline." **Actual dollars.**

The conversation your VP of Growth wants to have is: "We spent $X on this channel and it generated $Y in revenue." If your attribution system can't answer that question — even approximately — it's not ready.

### 3. Make It Trustworthy

Here's the test: would your VP of Finance sign off on the numbers? If the answer is "well, sort of, but there are caveats" — it's not ready.

Trust comes from transparency. Show your methodology. Document your assumptions. Acknowledge what you can't measure. A model that everyone understands and agrees is "80% right" is infinitely more useful than a black box that claims to be 100% accurate.

## The 80/20 of Attribution

You don't need a perfect attribution system. You need one that's **good enough to make better decisions than you're making today.**

For most SaaS companies in the $5M-$50M ARR range, that means:

- **Pick a simple model** (even last-touch) and apply it consistently
- **Connect it to revenue** (not just leads or pipeline)
- **Make it accessible** (a dashboard your CMO and CFO both check)
- **Iterate** (improve the model quarterly, not annually)

Perfection is the enemy of progress here. The teams that win at attribution aren't the ones with the fanciest models — they're the ones who shipped something, learned from it, and improved.

## When the Data Foundation Is the Real Problem

Nine times out of ten, when a client comes to us with an "attribution problem," what they actually have is a data foundation problem. The tracking is incomplete, the pipeline is brittle, and the warehouse is a mess.

Attribution is the last mile. You can't build it on a broken foundation.

If that sounds like your situation, [start with a data audit](/services/audits) before investing in attribution tooling. It'll save you months of frustration and a lot of money.

## When to Call for Help

If your team has been debating attribution models for more than a quarter without shipping anything, you don't have a data problem. You have a process problem.

If your marketing and finance teams are using different numbers and nobody knows which ones are right, you have a trust problem.
