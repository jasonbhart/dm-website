## Book a Discovery Call

A discovery call is a focused 30-minute conversation where we learn about your data challenges and determine if we can help.

**What to expect:**

- A focused conversation about your specific situation
- An honest assessment of whether we're the right fit
- If there's a match, we'll outline a **paid discovery engagement** — a scoped, short-term project where we dig deep into your data, diagnose the real issues, and deliver a clear action plan

**No pitch. No obligation. Just clarity.**

We don't do hourly billing. All engagements are scoped and priced upfront so you know exactly what you're getting.

**Before you book, it helps to have in mind:**

- Your company size and stage (ARR or funding status)
- The primary data or analytics challenge you're facing
- Your timeline — is this urgent or exploratory?
