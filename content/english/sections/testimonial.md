testimonials:
  - name: "Tony R."
    designation: "VP of Growth, Stackline"

    content: "We were spending six figures a month on ads and couldn't tell which channels were actually driving pipeline. Domain Methods rebuilt our attribution from the ground up — now we have a single source of truth for ROAS that both marketing and finance trust. No more defending numbers in board meetings."

  - name: "Jimmy K."
    designation: "Head of Data, Beacon Analytics"

    content: "Most consultants we talked to could write SQL but couldn't explain why it mattered to the business. Jason got up to speed on our stack in days, not weeks, and built a dbt foundation with real governance — not just documentation nobody reads. Our pipeline reliability went from constant firefighting to something we barely think about."

  - name: "Betty M."
    designation: "VP of Revenue Operations, Clarify HQ"
    avatar: "/images/testimonials/bm.png"
    content: "We had five different dashboards showing five different revenue numbers. Domain Methods didn't just pick one — they built a flexible data model that adapts as our business changes. For the first time, our CRO and CFO are looking at the same metrics. That alone was worth the engagement."

  - name: "Hank D."
    designation: "Head of Product, GrowthLoop"

    content: "I didn't want a six-month roadmap — I wanted to prove that our warehouse data could reduce churn this quarter. Domain Methods shipped our first reverse ETL workflow in three weeks and it moved the needle immediately. That MVP approach is exactly what PLG teams need."
