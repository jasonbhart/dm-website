    title: "B2B SaaS + Attribution Rebuild = One Number Marketing and Finance Both Trust"
    content: "We were spending six figures a month on ads with no way to tell which channels were actually driving pipeline. Domain Methods rebuilt our attribution model from the ground up — unified data from ad platforms, CRM, and billing into one trusted pipeline. We went from defending numbers in every board meeting to making budget allocation decisions in hours."

    title: "Mid-Market SaaS + dbt Foundation = Pipeline Reliability Nobody Has to Think About"
    content: "Most consultants could write SQL but couldn't explain why it mattered to the business. Domain Methods built a dbt foundation with real governance — tested models, clear documentation, and automated quality checks. Our team went from constant firefighting to barely thinking about pipeline reliability."

    title: "B2B SaaS + Flexible Data Model = CRO and CFO Looking at the Same Metrics"
    content: "We had five dashboards showing five different revenue numbers. Domain Methods didn't just pick one — they built a flexible data model that adapts as our business changes. For the first time, our CRO and CFO look at the same metrics. That alignment alone was worth the engagement."

    title: "PLG SaaS + Reverse ETL MVP = Churn Reduction in Three Weeks"
    content: "I didn't want a six-month roadmap — I wanted to prove that our warehouse data could reduce churn this quarter. Domain Methods shipped a reverse ETL workflow in three weeks that synced churn-risk scores to our CRM and triggered automated outreach. It moved the needle immediately. That MVP approach is exactly what PLG teams need."
