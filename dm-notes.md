### 8. Risk Assessment (Pre-Mortem)

**Why might the business fail?**

* **Internal:** "Client work takes priority over internal work".
* **False Consensus:** The risk isn't just misalignment, but toxic agreement: "Everyone is down for everything, so alignment isn't that hard" .
* **Personality Flaw:** A recognized internal weakness is being a **"People pleaser,"** which threatens the ability to set boundaries.
* **Execution:** "Lack of confidence / lack of conviction" .
* **Client Expectation:** A specific risk is **"Unrealistic client expectations"**.
* **Market:** "Deal flow isn't the right one" leading to "Herding Cats".
* **Operational:** "Scope Creep" and "Feast or Famine" cycles.
